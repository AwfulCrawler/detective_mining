Full attempt at recreating figures 11 and 12 of the paper.  The code produces figures for when detectives mine the tip of the selfish chain or 2nd from the top.
Further, it produces figure 11's for which the selfish miner's relative extra revenue (RER) is consistent with that shown for gamma = 0.5 in figure 11.  In the paper,
as mentioned in the main readme, figures 11 and 12 are inconsistent.

I am not 100% confident in these results but at least the selfish mining RER is consistent between figures which is something.

This is still a work in progress.
